### UoL Data Visualization projecting examining exercise habits before and during the Covid-19 pandemic

This project was created as part of my Data Science MSc. The task was to create and design a simple survey and then present the results using Python data visualisation tools and Jupyter Notebooks. I chose to focus on exercise habits before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, to see if and how habits had changed.

The data processing, cleaning and plotting code can be found in the appendix section at the end of the Jupyter notebook. This keeps the main report clean and easy to read, with simple calls to functions and data frames in order to display the necessary visuals. 

The notebook makes use of several libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
